# MySnakeGame
<p>
  Keeping my adventures in GameDev, I decided to recreate some classics. And what a better starter than the Snake Game?
  This game basically worked as a way to try different thing in Game Developing. I tried to do different things, might not be the best, neither prettier choices, but experience new things is always good.
</p>

<h2> Different choices </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Used a Canvas/Panel as a Start Menu</li>
  <li> Used trail renderer for the first time</li>
  <li> Worked with PlayerPrefs archives (HighScore)</li>
  <li> Game is continuous, no game over scene/canvas </li> 
</ul>

<h2> New Choices Considerations </h2>
<ul>
  <li> The Start Menu still ugly, but learning how to use it as a Panel it's a great alternative </li>
  <li> The trail renderer was fun, not quite what I wanted, but it's deffinetly not bat</li>
  <li> HighScore are a must in almost evry game, it's a must know skill </li>
  <li> The game over screen turned out to be useless in this game and it's better this way</li>
</ul>

<h2> Little Showdown </h2>
